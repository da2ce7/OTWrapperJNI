Welcome to the Open Transactions SWIG-JNI wrapper for Java Projects
==============================================================

This project was originally from the Moneychanger repository; it has been split-off so that any java project can easily make use of OT functions.

Most of this project was automatically generated by  swig,  please view the swig folder under the Open Transactions Repository for more information.

Enjoy!
